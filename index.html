                <p>Orangutans are magnificent great apes that live only in the forests of Borneo and Sumatra. They are in grave danger of extinction because of many factors such as deforestation, hunting, illegal trade, and global warming.

                <h2>Threats</h2>

                <p>Orangutans are losing their home due to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Deforestation, logging, mining, agriculture, and fires. Their habitat is being converted into palm
                        oil plantations, which are used for many products such as food, cosmetics, and biofuels. Palm oil is
                        the most widely consumed vegetable oil in the world and its demand is increasing rapidly. According
                        to WWF, around 24 million hectares of rainforest were cleared in Indonesia between 1990 and 2015,
                        mostly for palm oil production.</li>
                    <li>Hunting and killing for their meat, body parts, or as pets. They are often caught in snares or traps
                        set by poachers or farmers who see them as pests. The illegal wildlife trade is another major threat
                        to orangutans, as they are sold on the black market for high prices. Baby orangutans are especially
                        vulnerable, as they are often taken from their mothers who are killed in the process.According to
                        the Orangutan Conservancy, it is estimated that up to 5,000 orangutans are killed each year.</li>
                    <li>Climate change. Rising temperatures and changing rainfall patterns can alter the availability of
                        food and water for orangutans and other wildlife. Droughts and fires can also destroy large areas of
                        forest and release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. According to the Orangutan SSP, the 2015
                        El Ni√±o event caused severe fires that burned over 2 million hectares of land in Indonesia,
                        including orangutan habitat.</li>

                <h2>How We Can Help</h2>

                <p>There are many ways we can help orangutans and their habitat. Here's just a few:</p>

                    <ul>

                        <li><strong>Support conservation organizations.</strong>There are many organizations that work to
                            protect orangutans and their habitat, such as Project Orangs, WWF, Smithsonian's National
                            Zoo, Orangutan Conservancy, Orangutan SSP, and Orangutan Foundation International. You can
                            donate, volunteer, or join their campaigns and events.</li>
                        <li><strong>Avoid products that contain palm oil or choose products that use sustainable palm
                                oil.</strong> Palm oil is the main cause of orangutan habitat loss. You can check the
                            ingredients list or use apps such as Palm Oil Scanner or Sustainable Palm Oil Shopping to scan
                            barcodes and find out if a product contains palm oil. You can also look for products that use
                            sustainable palm oil certified by the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO).</li>
                        <li><strong>Reduce your carbon footprint.</strong> Climate change affects orangutans and their habitat.
                            You can use renewable energy sources, drive less, recycle, and plant trees. You can also offset your
                            emissions by supporting projects that conserve forests and wildlife.</li>
                        <li><strong>Spread awareness and educate others.</strong> You can share information on social media,
                            write blogs or articles, create posters or flyers, or host events or fundraisers. You can also use
                            this website as a source of information and inspiration.</li>
                        <li><strong>Respect orangutans and their habitat.</strong> If you visit them in the wild or in
                            captivity, follow the guidelines and rules of the local authorities and conservation groups. Do not
                            feed, touch, or disturb orangutans or other wildlife. Do not buy or keep orangutans as pets.</li>

                    <h2>About Orangutans</h2>

                    <p>Orangutans are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The largest arboreal mammals and the most socially solitary of the great apes.</li>
                        <li>They spend most of their time in trees, using their long arms and grasping hands and feet to move
                            through the branches.</li>
                        <li>They have long, sparse orange or reddish hair and distinctive fingerprints.</li>
                        <li>They have large jaws and flattened noses in concave faces.</li>
                        <li>They have flabby throat sacs, which become very large in adult males.</li>
                        <li>Adult males also have large cheek pads and deep chests.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Intelligence</h3>

                    <p>Orangutans are highly intelligent and share 96.4% of our genes. They:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Have cognitive maps and can remember where to find food and water sources.</li>
                        <li>Can use tools for various purposes, such as digging, scratching, or cracking nuts.</li>
                        <li>Can communicate with vocalizations, gestures, and facial expressions.</li>
                        <li>Have a complex social structure based on female philopatry and male dispersal. Females usually stay
                            in their natal home range, while males leave when they reach adolescence.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Reproduction</h3>

                    <p>Orangutans have a very low reproductive rate, which makes them
                        vulnerable to population declines. They:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Give birth to one infant at a time about every 3-5 years.</li>
                        <li>The infant stays with its mother for 6-9 years, learning how to survive in the forest.</li>
                        <li>The mother-infant bond is very strong and lasts for life.</li>
                        <li>Can live up to 50 years in the wild and 60 years in captivity.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Fun Facts</h2>

                    <p>Here are some fun facts about orangutans:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The name orangutan means "man of the forest" in the Malay language.</li>
                        <li>Orangutans are "gardeners" of the forest, playing a vital role in seed dispersal and forest
                            regeneration.</li>
                        <li>Orangutans can make nests in trees of vegetation to sleep at night and rest during the day. They can
                            also make pillows, blankets, roofs, or bunk beds for their nests.</li>
                        <li>Orangutans have a diverse diet of over 400 types of food, including fruits, leaves, bark, flowers,
                            insects, honey, eggs, and even small vertebrates.</li>
                        <li>Orangutans can make over 40 different vocalizations, such as grunts, squeaks, roars, kisses, and
                            long calls. The long call is a loud series of sounds that can carry over 1 kilometer in the forest.
                            It is used by males to attract females or warn other males.</li>
                    </ul>
